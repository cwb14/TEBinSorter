# TEsorter2_mmseqs

Fork of TEsorter2 with pass-2 similarity search migrated from `blastn` to
[mmseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2). The HMM-based pass-1
(the source of the 500× speedup) is untouched.

These mmseqs edits are ported line-by-line from the `my-new-idea2` branch of
[github.com/cwb14/TEsorter](https://github.com/cwb14/TEsorter) — originally
applied against upstream TEsorter, now re-applied here so they sit on top of
TEsorter2's faster HMM core.

## Additional runtime dependency

`mmseqs` binary must be on `$PATH`. Install with conda:

```
mamba install -c bioconda mmseqs2
```

Everything else is unchanged from TEsorter2 (pyhmmer, pyfastx, numpy).

## New / renamed CLI options

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `-dp2`, `--disable-pass2` | off | Skip the mmseqs2 pass-2 (HMM-only classification) |
| `-rule`, `--pass2-rule I-C-L` | `80-80-80` | Pass-2 threshold as identity-coverage-length (percent-percent-bp) |
| `--pass2-classified-fasta FASTA` | none | Optional FASTA of prior classifications to augment the pass-2 target pool. Headers must be shaped `>id#Order/Superfamily/Clade` |
| `--mmseqs-sensitivity S` | mmseqs2 default | Passed through as `mmseqs -s` |
| `--mmseqs-cov-mode {0,1,2}` | `0` (query coverage) | Passed through as `mmseqs --cov-mode` |

## What changed vs stock TEsorter2

- `tesorter2/blast_pass2.py` — internals swapped from `blastn`+`makeblastdb` to
  `mmseqs easy-search`. Dropped the `multiprocessing.Pool` chunking layer
  (mmseqs is natively multithreaded via `--threads`). The SQLite `blast_hits`
  schema and the public symbols (`blast_pass2`, `store_blast_hits`,
  `classify_from_blast`) are retained so no downstream consumer (pipeline.py,
  tesorter_compat.py, classifier.py, results.py) needs to change. mmseqs
  bits / fident / qcov are remapped to the BLAST-shaped columns at insert
  time; `evalue` and `slen` columns hold sentinel zeros (unread downstream).
- `tesorter2/mmseqs.py` — new. Wrapper around `mmseqs easy-search`, split-alignment
  merger (`_MAX_SPLIT_GAP = 500`), M8 parser, best-hit selector.
- `tesorter2/pass2_external.py` — new. Helpers for `--pass2-classified-fasta`:
  header parsing, classification-dict merging, coordinate-based header
  upgrade, FASTA merging with dedup + ATCG cleaning.
- `tesorter2/pipeline.py` / `tesorter2/tesorter_compat.py` — wire the five new CLI args
  through the pass-2 call.

# TEsorter2
 
Fast, divergence-robust classification of transposable elements.
 
TEsorter2 is a reimplementation of [TEsorter](https://github.com/zhangrengang/TEsorter) that
keeps its classification semantics while introducing three major improvements:
 
1. **Speed**: HMMER's limited parallelism is replaced by [pyHMMER](https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io/)
   with workload-aware load balancing, plus an optional facet pre-screen and a parallelized
   second-pass BLAST.
2. **Sensitivity on degraded copies**: an optional [BATH](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/BATH)
   engine performs frameshift-aware translated search directly against nucleotide sequence.
3. **Reproducibility**: clade assignment uses a score-weighted vote instead of a count-based vote
   whose ties were broken by internal data-structure ordering.
It also adds multi-database reconciliation in a single run and a genome mode for both engines.

Note: I should switch from default task (megablast) to dc-megablast.

## Installation

### conda (recommended)

Installs the external binaries (HMMER, BLAST+) and TEsorter2 in one step:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KGerhardt/TEsorter2.git
cd TEsorter2
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tesorter2
```

### pip

Requires Python >= 3.9. HMMER and BLAST+ must already be on `PATH`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KGerhardt/TEsorter2.git
```

### Databases

The HMM databases (REXdb, GyDB2, LINE, TIR, AnnoSINE) ship inside the package, as they do in
TEsorter, so there is no download step and no configuration: `tesorter2 input.fasta` works
straight after install.

To use a custom collection of HMM databases instead, point TEsorter2 at its directory:

```bash
tesorter2 input.fasta --db-dir /path/to/db     # or: export TESORTER2_DB=/path/to/db
```

Individual databases can also be passed by path: `-d /path/to/custom.hmm`.

### BATH (optional, only for `--bath`)

[BATH](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/BATH) is not available on conda and must be built from
source. Put `bathsearch`/`bathconvert` on `PATH`, or set `BATH_BIN_DIR`.

## Choosing an engine
 
| | Element mode (pre-extracted TEs) | Genome mode (assembly) |
|---|---|---|
| **Intact / low-divergence sequence** | **pyHMMER** (default) : fastest | **pyHMMER** or **BATH** |
| **Degraded / frameshifted copies** | **BATH** (`--bath`) : slower than pyHMMER, more sensitive | **BATH** (`--bath`) : both faster *and* more sensitive |

---
 
## Search modes
 
### Default mode (pyHMMER)
 
Single-pass `--nobias` search against all models via pyHMMER, in-process: `hmmsearch` for
amino-acid databases, `nhmmer` for DNA databases (`sine`, `sine-so`).
 
- Model-cost-aware parallel load balancing chooses between pyHMMER's `queries` and `targets`
  parallelization per model bin, reaching near-full CPU utilization (see
  [Parallel strategy](#parallel-strategy)).
- Results are written to a SQLite database, so filtering and re-analysis do not require re-running
  the search.
  
### DNA databases (nhmmer)

DNA profile databases are searched with `nhmmer`, not `hmmsearch`. `hmmsearch` only scores the
strand it is handed, so it misses every minus-strand copy, and pyHMMER rejects sequences over
100k residues outright. `nhmmer` scans both strands in one pass and handles long targets.

On 5 Mb of rice against `sine`, nhmmer records hits on both strands (15,992 `+` / 15,821 `-`)
where hmmsearch records no strand at all, and classifies 50 windows against hmmsearch's 37. The
35 windows both engines classify are almost all `+` or unstranded; every one of the 15 windows
only nhmmer recovers is on the minus strand, so the gain is the strand hmmsearch cannot see
rather than a looser threshold.

`--dna-engine hmmsearch` restores the old single-strand behaviour for comparison.

**Known limitation — hit filters on the DNA path are inherited from the protein path.** DNA hits
are filtered with the same thresholds as protein domains (coverage ≥ 20%, E-value ≤ 1e-3,
accuracy ≥ 0.5, normalized score ≥ 0.1). Two consequences on the rice/`sine` fixture:

- **Two of the four filters never discriminate.** Accuracy and coverage reject nothing: the same
  50 windows are classified whether the cutoffs are at their defaults or at zero. Only E-value
  and normalized score bind.
- **The E-value cutoff is not comparable between engines.** nhmmer scores against a long-target
  search space spanning both strands, hmmsearch against a per-sequence protein-style one, so the
  same alignment gets very different E-values — for `SHANSINE_MT` on one rice window, 5.5e-05
  under hmmsearch versus 0.0014 under nhmmer. A single `1e-3` cutoff is therefore stricter for
  nhmmer than for hmmsearch, and the two windows hmmsearch classifies that nhmmer does not are
  both boundary misses of this kind, not detection failures — nhmmer finds hundreds of raw hits
  in each.

The practical effect is bounded: dropping the E-value filter altogether raises the count from 50
to 59, so no threshold choice recovers much more. SINE-specific filters are not implemented; use
`--dna-engine hmmsearch` if you need the old behaviour for comparison.

### Facet mode (`--facet`)
 
Pre-screens amino-acid databases with spliced sub-HMMs ("facets") to route each sequence only to
the models likely to produce its best hit:
 
1. **Facet screen**: tiered sub-HMMs (96 → 64 → 48 → 32 aa) searched against all six translated
   frames.
2. **Targeted verification**: top facet hit per domain family verified with a full-model
   `--nobias` search.
3. **Cross-family completion**: verified frames searched for missing domain families.
4. **Legacy fallback**: frames with no facet signal get a full search.
DNA databases always use the default search (nhmmer); DNA facets do not repay their overhead.
Incompatible with `--bath` and `--genome`.
 
### BATH mode (`--bath`)
 
Replaces pyHMMER with `bathsearch --fs` for amino-acid databases. BATH aligns protein pHMMs
directly against raw nucleotide input, allowing the alignment to change frame at indels and read
through stop codons under a frameshift penalty, so a domain interrupted by a frameshift is
recovered as a single hit with its true extent. No six-frame translation is performed.
 
- HMMER3 databases are converted on first use (`bathconvert`) and cached as `{db}.bath.hmm`.
- Hits are normalized into the same internal schema as the HMMER path, so classification,
  reconciliation and BLAST pass-2 are unchanged.
- BATH tblout reports no per-residue posterior probability, so `acc` is set to `1.0` and the
  minimum-accuracy filter is a no-op for BATH hits.
- Minus-strand coordinates are normalized to ascending order, with strand encoded in the target
  suffix, matching the HMMER convention.
- Incompatible with `--facet`.
- 
### Genome mode (`--genome`)
 
Treats the input as whole-genome sequence rather than pre-extracted elements: detects TE protein
domains throughout, classifies **each domain individually**, resolves overlapping features, and
emits a domain-level GFF3 plus a summary table. It does not produce a per-element `.cls.tsv` and
does not run BLAST pass-2, matching TEsorter's `-genome` behaviour.
 
- **pyHMMER**: six-frame translates each window, then maps amino-acid envelope coordinates back to
  nucleotide space. Window size is capped automatically to stay under pyHMMER's 100k-residue
  per-sequence limit; the retained overlap exceeds any TE domain, so no domains are lost.
- **`--bath`**: runs `bathsearch --fs` directly on nucleotide windows. The tblout already reports
  nucleotide coordinates and strand, so no translation or coordinate back-mapping is needed. BATH
  additionally streams long targets in ~0.25 Mb blocks overlapped by the maximum expected hit
  length, reconciling boundary duplicates internally.
Window size: `--win-size` (default `1e6`), `--win-ovl` (default `1e5`).
Requires at least one amino-acid database; DNA-only databases (`sine`) are skipped.
Incompatible with `--facet`.
 
### Multiple databases
 
TEsorter2 accepts several databases in one run (`-d rexdb,gydb`) and reconciles them in three
stages:
 
1. **Independent classification**: each database classifies every element on its own, emitting a
   per-database `{prefix}.{db}.cls.tsv` in native TEsorter format.
2. **Name harmonization**: per-database calls are projected onto a unified taxonomy that collapses
   superfamily synonyms (e.g. `Pao` → `Bel-Pao`) and unifies clade names. Lineages with no
   established equivalent are kept distinct to avoid spurious agreement.
3. **Scope-aware hierarchical reconciliation**: a hierarchical vote at Order → Superfamily →
   Clade. At each level candidate labels are weighted by the summed normalized domain score per
   database, and only entries consistent with the winning label advance. The superfamily level is
   *scope-aware*: a database may only elect a superfamily it models with at least 2 clades.
Every per-database call is retained in the `SecondaryHits` column as
`db:order/superfamily/clade=score`, in descending order of evidence — always on the database's
**native** names, so the audit trail survives harmonization. Use `--compat-tesorter-output`
for the original 7-column format.

> **Compatibility contract.** The per-database `{prefix}.{db}.cls.tsv` is **never harmonized** and
> always carries exactly TEsorter's original 7 columns. Downstream pipelines — EDTA reads
> `*.{db}db.cls.tsv` positionally as `(id, Order, Superfamily)` — depend on this, so harmonized
> names and any added columns belong in the combined `{prefix}.cls.tsv` only. Note that
> harmonization rewrites `Order` and `Superfamily` too, not just `Clade` (`Pao`→`Bel-Pao`,
> `pararetrovirus`→`LTR`/`Caulimoviridae`), which is precisely why it must not reach the per-database
> file. If you ever feed the *combined* file to EDTA, extend the `%lib` hash in its
> `cleanup_misclas.pl` first — it knows `pararetrovirus` but not `Caulimoviridae` or `Bel-Pao`.

Harmonization is gated on at least two databases voting on an element: a single-database run keeps
native names throughout, so `-d rexdb` alone is unaffected. The two tables driving stages 2 and 3
are `tesorter2/database/clade_harmonization.tsv` (mapping) and `clade_scope.tsv` (which superfamily
each database can resolve at lineage level). The REXdb↔GyDB lineage equivalences — `Ale`/`Retrofit`,
`Ivana`/`Oryco`, `Tekay`/`Del`, `SIRE`, `Tork`, `Reina`, `CRM`, `Galadriel`, `Athila` — are asserted
from [Neumann et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13100-018-0144-1) (*Mob DNA* 10:1), not fitted
to any dataset. Both tables are read from the resolved `--db-dir` first and fall back to the
packaged copies, so a custom database collection still harmonizes.

Where one database resolves *below* the level both can express, the combined file adds a `Lineage`
column rather than forking the clade name. REXdb splits the Tat group into `Ogre`/`Retand`/`TatI-III`
while GyDB has a single `tat`: both are reported as `Clade=Tat`, and REXdb's finer call lands in
`Lineage`. Lineage is chosen among the databases that actually resolve one, so the finer call
survives even when the coarser database wins the score vote. (`Tatius` is not part of the group —
the REXdb HMM places it at `OTA/Tatius`, a sibling of `Tat`.)
 
### Sequence Ontology

`Order/Superfamily/Clade` is TEsorter's vocabulary, not a standard one. Every classification is
also resolved to a [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org) term, so results are
comparable with other annotation tools:

- `{prefix}.cls.tsv` gains `SO_name` and `SO_ID` columns (e.g. `Copia_LTR_retrotransposon`,
  `SO:0002264`).
- Genome-mode GFF3 features carry `Ontology_term=SO:...` plus `so_name=`. The feature type stays
  `CDS`: these features are protein domains, not elements, so typing one as
  `Gypsy_LTR_retrotransposon` would assert the domain *is* the retrotransposon.

The mapping authority is [EDTA's `TE_Sequence_Ontology.txt`](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA/blob/master/bin/TE_Sequence_Ontology.txt),
bundled in `tesorter2/data/`. All 59 Order/Superfamily labels the bundled databases can emit
resolve to a specific SO term; nothing falls back to the generic `repeat_region`.

For lineages with no SO term of their own, EDTA files a descriptive name under a generic
accession (`CR1_LINE_retrotransposon` is not a real SO term; its `SO:0000194` is
`LINE_element`'s). `SO_name` keeps EDTA's name for interoperability, while anything written as an
ontology term resolves to the real one.

`--compat-tesorter-output` suppresses the SO columns, keeping the original 7-column format.

### Clade voting
 
Within each database the winning clade is chosen by a **score-weighted vote**: each domain
contributes a length-normalized score (`dom_score / model_len`) to its clade, and the highest
summed score wins:
 
$$\hat{c} = \arg\max_{c} \sum_{d \in D_c} \frac{\text{score}_d}{\text{len}_d}$$
 
Normalizing by model length controls for the tendency of longer profiles to accumulate higher raw
scores, making domains comparable. Ties fall through to the existing mixture/completeness rules;
Order and Superfamily are inherited from the winning clade.
 
This replaces TEsorter's raw domain-count plurality, which breaks ties by position in an internal
collection rather than by any biological signal, causing sibling-clade swaps (Reina↔Tekay,
Ale↔Alesia) to flip depending on search engine. Pass `--compat-tesorter-voting` to restore the
original behaviour.

## Extended methods
 
### HMM facets
 
pyHMMER exposes an HMM's emission probabilities in Python. TEsorter2 uses them to locate conserved
subregions that most influence HMMER's decision-making, and extracts each such region into a
"facet": a complete, self-contained HMM whose emission and transition probabilities are cloned from
its parent over the corresponding window.
 
Facets are sized at 96, 64, 48 or 32 amino acids, using the longest size the parent supports;
models of ≤32 aa are used as-is. Windows are chosen to maximize the summed emission probability
over the parent and may overlap by at most 33% of facet length.
 
For a parent HMM of length *M* and a query of length *N*, one `hmmsearch` is a dynamic-programming
matrix of size *M × N*. A facet search replaces *M* with a facet size *F* (*F* < *M*), yielding an
*F × N* slice with a proportional reduction in work. Three properties make this profitable:
 
- **Short models are more decisive.** A full-length model accumulates information about search
  effort across the whole sequence; a short model confirms or rejects a local region quickly.
- **Facet scores predict full-length scores.** A good facet hit almost always implies a good
  full-length hit, making facets a fast approximation of the final score.
- **Facet sizes pack SIMD lanes.** 96/64/32 aa are consumed in 16-aa bites by HMMER's internals,
  reducing low-level CPU waste relative to less divisible sizes.
Facets do not reproduce their parent's domain detections exactly, so a full-length verification is
still required for correctness. The acceleration comes from *skipping* verifications: the TE HMMs
within each database are highly redundant (either wholly, as in single-type databases, or in
subcollections, as in REXdb and GyDB), so most models in a cluster hit the same sequence at
differing strengths and all but the best are discarded downstream anyway — yet detecting a weak hit
costs exactly as much as detecting a strong one. TEsorter2 ships precomputed all-vs-all similarity
graphs (obtained by searching each model's consensus against every other model in the database)
that identify these clusters. Facet hits order the parent searches within each cluster from highest
to lowest, and verification stops as soon as a high-scoring parent is confirmed — typically 1–2
parent searches per cluster per sequence instead of dozens.
 
In effect, the deconfliction that would otherwise happen *after* an exhaustive search is moved
*before* it, at the cost of a cheap approximate screen. Post-filter agreement with the exhaustive
search is 99.98% at hit level and 99.8% at family recall (4 misses of 2,090 on rice REXdb).
 
The facet generation code is intentionally a separate module and is reusable in other projects.
 
### Parallel strategy
 
**Default search.** pyHMMER exposes two C-level parallelization schemes: `queries`, where each
thread takes one HMM and searches it against all sequences, and `targets`, where one sequence is
searched against models in parallel. `queries` is inherently more efficient unless there are few
models.
 
HMM runtime scales roughly with *M²*, so a single long model can dominate. AnnoSINE is the
pathological case: `SINE_SO` (M≈4,100) accounts for ~71% of the model set's runtime, and under
`queries` parallelism every other model finishes quickly while `SINE_SO` runs single-threaded for
>10× longer than all the rest combined.
 
TEsorter2 precomputes each model's expected cost (*M²*) and bins them: **small** models
(cost ≤ 75th percentile + 2×IQR for that database) run in `queries` mode; **large** models run in
`targets` mode. Sequences are reused from the same in-memory object across both searches, so the
split is essentially free, yielding near-full CPU utilization in the most efficient mode available
for each model class.
 
**Facet search.** Staged: facets from all models are searched with `--nobias` exactly as in the
default search; top facet hits per sequence are ordered by quality, noting each facet's parent;
each sequence is searched against its best facet's parent at full length. If it verifies, no
further searches run; otherwise the next-best facet hit for a *different* parent is tried. Most
sequences verify on the first attempt; almost all within three. Because verification stops at a
single best hit, a cross-family pass then searches each verified sequence against the top facet
hit's parent for every *other* TE family, preserving both primary and secondary labelling
sensitivity. Sequences still unclassified fall back to the legacy search.
 
The expensive part of HMMER is finding a match. Facets route each sequence only to the models
likely to produce its best hits, skipping the redundant weak hits that would be discarded anyway.
The leftovers sent to the legacy search are mostly genuine rejects with no TE signal, and are
cheap: a REXdb legacy search spends ~92% of its runtime on the ~71k of ~880k protein frames that
actually contain hits.

"""
cross_family.py — Complete missing family assignments for facet-classified frames.

After facet classification, some frames have hits for some families (e.g. RT, INT)
but not others (e.g. GAG, TPase). This module searches the missing families'
models against those frames to close the gap.

Only searches the specific (model, frame) pairs that are needed -- no redundant work.

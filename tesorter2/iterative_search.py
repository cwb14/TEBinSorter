"""
iterative_search.py — Facet screen → graph-guided confirmation → legacy fallback.

Orchestrates the iterative search process:
  1. Facet screen: bulk sub-HMM search, produces per-frame ranked candidate list
  2. Confirmation rounds: batched full-model searches guided by similarity graph,
     frames drop out as they confirm or exhaust candidates
  3. Legacy fallback: remaining unresolved frames get full nobias search

The work planner balances batches by estimated cost (M^2 * total_seqlen)
and is reused across all rounds.

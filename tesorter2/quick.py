"""
Quick mode: sub-HMM triage + single-model confirmation + legacy fallback.

1. Screen all frames with spliced sub-HMMs → assign each frame to its
   highest-scoring sub-HMM's parent model
2. Confirm each assignment with one nobias full-model search
3. Unassigned leftovers get full legacy search

Trades a small amount of recall for major speed improvement on the
confirmation step: most frames only need 1 full-model search instead
of 266.
